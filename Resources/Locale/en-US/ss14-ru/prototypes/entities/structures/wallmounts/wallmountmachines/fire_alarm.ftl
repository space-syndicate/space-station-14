ent-FireAlarm = fire alarm
    .desc = A fire alarm. Spicy!
ent-FireAlarmAssembly = fire alarm assembly
    .desc = A fire alarm assembly. Very mild.
ent-FireAlarmXeno = { ent-FireAlarm }
    .desc = An alien fire alarm. Works just the same!
ent-FireAlarmAssemblyXeno = { ent-FireAlarmAssembly }
    .desc = An alien fire alarm assembly. Good luck with the wires.
